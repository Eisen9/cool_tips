### Forking

// intro here

what is forking?
Suppose you see a cool open-source code on GitHub and you want to make some changes to it. What you do is you fork it and make changes to it as you please on your GitHub. The changes that you make will not affect the original repo.

Scenario:

Suppose you have made a fork from person's A GitHub.
You have a copy of person's A repo on your remote repository (on your GitHub).
You now, want to make some changes locally.
You made the changes and now push to your remote again.

If you wish, you can tell person A about your changes. This can be done by making a `pull request`. The reason it is called pull, because person A is the one who pulls your changes to their repo.

Now, person A can approve then merge your changes with their own.
