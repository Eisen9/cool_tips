## How to limit the number of characters in a line in VS Code, in atom, there is an extension to do that but I am not sure if there is one for that in VS code. I.e., when I write a line in vs code, I want the curser to go to the next line after a number of characters has been reached on the previous line.

Yes, there is a way to limit the number of characters in a line in VS Code. You can achieve this by configuring the "editor.rulers" setting in your VS Code settings. To automatically wrap your lines, you can configure the "editor.wordWrap" setting. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open VS Code and click on "File" in the menu bar.
2. Click on "Preferences" and then select "Settings". This will open the Settings panel.
3. In the search bar of the Settings panel, search for "editor.rulers" and "editor.wordWrap" respectively.
4. Configure the "editor.rulers" setting to specify the maximum line length.
5. Set the "editor.wordWrap" setting to "on" to automatically wrap your lines when you reach the maximum line length.
6. Save the changes to your settings.json file.
